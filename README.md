hello 👋  
i’m Mabutsi Kgaogelo Kgagara  

computer science × economics  
logic with a creative bias  

---

i write code  
in python, javascript, html, css —  
but mostly,  
i write ideas into systems.

---

i’m interested in how things work,  
why they work,  
and how they can work better.

for people.  
for data.  
for the real world.

---

to me, software is not just built.  
it is shaped.  

shaped by:
clarity  
curiosity  
and intention  

---

i enjoy solving problems that don’t announce themselves loudly,  
but reward patience and structured thinking.

sometimes that looks like data.  
sometimes interfaces.  
sometimes just cleaner logic.

---

currently focused on:  
learning deeply  
designing thoughtfully  
and building things that make sense before they impress.
